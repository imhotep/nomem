== Welcome to NoMem 

This application is pretty simple and does two simple things and tries to do them well:

- Manage your todo list (you can define a task, with a priority and whether you've achieved it or not)
- Manage your notes (you can add new notes with whatever you want inside: links, logs, ...) and view them from anywhere.

Most app try to be overkill and bloated with features. This one wants to be simple. So no comments, no sharing (it's meant to be used by the user for the user), no following and all of that on purpose.
